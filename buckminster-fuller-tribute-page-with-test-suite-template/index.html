<h3 id="headline">Here's some of Buckminster Fuller's inventions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dymaxion Sleep Schedule</strong> - A polyphasic sleep schedule he followed, consisting of four 30-minute naps throughout the day.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dymaxion World Map</strong> - A projection of a world map onto the surface of an icosahedron, which can be unfolded and flattened to two dimensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dymaxion Chronofile</strong> - Fuller documented his life every 15 minutes from 1920 to 1983. This document contains copies of all correspondence, bills, notes, sketches, and clippings from newspapers. This is said to be the most documented human life in history.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Geodesic Domes</strong> - Lattice shell structures which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. The geodesic dome was extremely strong for its weight, its "omnitriangulated" surface provided an inherently stable structure, and because a sphere encloses the greatest volume for the least surface area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Neologisms</strong> - Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "Spaceship Earth", "Dymaxion" house/car, ephemeralization, synergetic, and "tensegrity".
      </li>
    </ul>
